            <p>Hi!</p>

            <p>I'm Oliver Feighan, PhD candidate in quantum chemistry. My background is
            in electronic structure codes, but I'm interested in anything molecular,
            data science or computational.</p>

            <p>I've previously worked on a range of chemistry projects. On the scientific side,
            I've looked at tight-binding models and exciton theory to model light harvesting
            proteins, as well as methods for improving the success of SCF
            iterations in DFT calculations of large metal centre molecules.</p>

            <p>On the software development side, I've worked in different languages (python,
            C++ and a little fortran) to implement whole force-field methods and mean-field
            response programs down to writing machine-learning scripts and perform data analysis.</p>
            <p>Please find my contact details, CVs, personal history and other information here.</p>
